Optional Scripts
----------------------

There are three scripts that may optionally be used for your projects, and can be done using the following commands.

### sh build/scripts/cache

This will clear out any project cache files (for all projects), and is basically the forced equivalent of doing a ?flush for everything in your site.

### sh ~/path/to/permissions

This requires you to update the "{user}" and as such will need to be copied out to a location of your choice, and will apply the appropriate owner and permissions to both the cache and repository.

### sh build/scripts/recursive-status

This will recursively trigger a "git status" on each module directory found within your repository, primarily so you check for changes that may have been made in a module that hasn't been included in the repository code base.

### sh build/scripts/recursive-status assume-unchanged-listing

When you have patched files (resulting in them coming up as being modified during a recursive-status), you can `git update-index --assume-unchanged {file_name}`, and use this script with a parameter. This will not only list out the files that have been assumed unchanged, but it will also force the files to reflect the upstream. This makes sure you don't have local changes that have been accidentally made, however it will also remove any patches that were put in place. Therefore, you can run this and then `phing` to ensure the patches remain in place.
